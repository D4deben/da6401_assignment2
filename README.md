# da6401_assignment2

This Repository contain CNN implimentation using pytorch. 
The Dataset used is iNaturalist subset having 10 claases. 
Link: https://storage.googleapis.com/wandb_datasets/nature_12K.zip


-Part1 contains the 
  a. train.py  --> the training of CNN model using the train and validation dataset
  b. evaluate.py -> for evaluating the model on test dataset
  c. model.py -> the cnn architecture
  d. requirement.txt -> the required library for trunning the files
  e. visualize.py -> visualizing the filter and the feature map at the first layer 
  f. README.md -> discuss about part A
  g. saved_model -> best model trained after analysing the hyperparameter.Conv5 CNN model

- PartB.pynb => Contain the notebook where all the experiments and hyperparameter tunning trying out different models for fine tunning and etc are done. This is an rough notebook.
- parta.iynb => contains the rough version of experiment for part A of the assignment. It is version 1. 
- dl-a2.ipynb => contains the rough experiment work for part A version 2.
- final-cnn.ipynb => is the final notebook containg all the solution code in a clean and modular manner how it was implemented in the rough one.
